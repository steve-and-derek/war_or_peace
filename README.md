## War or Peace

Welcome! This repo contains a simplified, text-based version of the card game War. This was created for my very first project in mod1 of the backend program at Turing School of Software and Design.

Here are instructions if you'd like to play the game yourself:
1. Clone down the repository to a new directory.
2. Access the `war_or_peace` directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following terminal command: `ruby war_or_peace_runner.rb`

Enjoy!
